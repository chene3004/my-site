                   <p>Designing books was a very large pull for me. I cant quite put my finger on exactly why but I always had a lot of fun laying out books. The first example of which was for the Graphic Design 1 class was  a project where we had to take a book we liked and reset it in type. The book I chose was Fyodor Dostoevskyâ€™s Crime and Punishment. At first this project seemed super easy as I have always thought of books as quite homogeneous, but I never realized how many parts there are even for each page, let alone formating the section heads.

In another class we had been given the project of typesetting a textbook on the history of typography. Here we were given the text and had to find pictures to go with it. This project really showed me how important it is to have a system to design by otherwise the product will end up messy</p>

                   <p>LOOK was a campaign I created for my Graphic Design 2 class. Our instructions were to create a social awareness campaign. As someone who bikes around Boston frequently, I chose to do a bike safety public awareness campaign based around the idea that people need to become used to looking out for bikes on the road as the do with cars. 


This project was a great way to put together all if not most of the skills I had learned in the previous 2 years to try and design one cohesive brand. 

For the campaign I had to create a series of posters as well as a video clip, murals, bumper stickers and a book explaining the campaign and the look.  </p>

                   <p>Im a graphic design major and this website is just a quick look at the small portfolio I've built in boston. I entered into college not knowing what I wanted to major in. As an undecided student I wanted to take advantage of the liberal arts program to really try to find what I was passionate about. I knew that I loved to create, but I didnâ€™t know how I wanted to peruse that dream or even really a firm grasp on what those options were.

Graphic design really started to appeal to me as a way of realizing that creative dream when I started to really understand what it means to be a graphic designer. This was a slow process but with every class and with every project i became more and more comfortable with the idea that this is what I wanted to do. </p>

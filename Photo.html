                 <div class = "textbody"> 
                   <p>This class was my first real digital photography class and I was pretty excited about it. We used the class in order to learn about influential photographers as well as talking about composition, light, and depth; among other things. I found that I really enjoyed taking photos of the architecture in my area of town. The contrast of the medical buildings against the residential houses was really interesting and getting to explore this was a lot of fun.
The biggest challenge in this class/ for the final was to reduce all the photos i had taken down to what i thought were the best 10-15. There were so many photos that i liked but forcing myself to cut most of them out really taught me to look for the links between photos that make them greater than their sum. Finding thematic similarities and underlying connections has made other curation exercises that I have done since, vastly more easy.  </p>

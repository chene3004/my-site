                   <p>This climate change infographic was a project for Typography 2. This was the first time I was designing something from the ground up based off of research I had done. Although the design work was not necessarily my best, this project helped me to practice and experience what it is like to try and curate a theme throughout a piece of work. 

In addition, one of the biggest challenges I faced in creating this piece was trying to boil all the notes I had taken down to something that could comfortably fit on a poster. Even though I tried to convert as much of it as I could into charts, diagrams and tables, it still ended up feeling very text heavy. But the process of taking research and translating it into a very digestible form was one where I had a lot of fun.</p>
